## oh, hi üëãüèª 

With a background in Graphic Design and Visual Arts, I have expanded my career into Software Development. Now, I merge both fields in my professional work and personal projects.
After finishing my BFA and MFA at the University of Malaga, I enrolled i a Higher Degree in Web/Software Development. I quickly became interested in areas such as UI, data visualization, modeling languages, or semantic web.

I am currently working in the mornings as a Front-End developer while doing an internship in Telef√≥nica-UMA chair participating in the OntoExhibit research project, a web Ontology with a semantic model for publishing information about art exhibitions. As a developer I am deeply committed to following best practices and standards in clean code and clean architectures, accessibility and design patterns. Also, as a visual artist, my field of research is focused on digital and post-digital art practices, internet poetics and creative coding.

üåº Feel free to contact me :)
